# Data Visualization with Pandas

This project explores data visualization techniques using the Pandas library in Python. It focuses on analyzing and visualizing an ice cream ratings dataset to uncover patterns and insights related to preferences across different days of the year.

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset comprises ice cream ratings collected over various days. While specific details of the dataset are not provided, typical analyses may include:

* Daily ratings of different ice cream flavors
* Trends in preferences over time
* Seasonal variations in ratings

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Programming Language**: Python
* **Libraries**:

  * Pandas
  * Matplotlib
  * Seaborn
* **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Project Structure

* `Data Visualization with Pandas.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis and visualization processes.
